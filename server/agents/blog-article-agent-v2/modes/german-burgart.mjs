 # YOUR THREE STYLE GUIDES
 
 ## Article 1: Code Faster in Cursor: A Pragmatic Guide to Voice Prompting
 
 [#ai](https://dev.to/t/ai)[#programming](https://dev.to/t/programming)[#cursor](https://dev.to/t/cursor)[#whisper](https://dev.to/t/whisper)
 
 ## The Problem: The Keyboard Bottleneck
 
 For AI to work well, it needs **context** and **clarity**. Vague instructions lead to mediocre or wrong results. But writing _really_ detailed and long prompts is tedious.
 
 [![Typing slowly](https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fvi91b0lw8ckhp36mmxpd.png)](https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fvi91b0lw8ckhp36mmxpd.png)
 
 _Writing detailed prompts manually can be slow._
 
 The bottleneck _is_ our keyboard. Typing is slow compared to speaking. It limits the amount of detail that can be easily included in a prompt before fatigue sets in or the train of thought is lost.
 
 ## The Solution: Dictate with Whisper
 
 Here's the trick: use **Whisper** to dictate prompts directly into Cursor. Speaking is ~5x faster than typing. This enables:
 
 1. **Creating Very Long Prompts:** It's easy to dictate 50 lines of detailed instructions, explaining _exactly_ what's needed, which files to consider, what logic to follow, and what to avoid. Typing that amount would be torture.
 2. **Increasing Detail Exponentially:** When speaking, it's natural to add more context and examples. It's possible to "think out loud," rambling a bit. The AI is often good at filtering noise and extracting the crucial info from the monologue.
 3. **Reducing Friction:** The process is almost instantaneous. Using an app like **WisprFlow** ([https://wisprflow.ai/](https://wisprflow.ai/)) allows mapping dictation to a key (e.g., \`Fn\`). Press the key, speak, release the key. The text _magically_ appears in Cursor's Composer. Then just hit \`Enter\`.
 
 [![WisprFlow Demo](https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Ffpamxvti54kcnb5b5ysx.gif)](https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Ffpamxvti54kcnb5b5ysx.gif)
 
 _Dictating a prompt quickly using WisprFlow and Cursor._
 
 ## The Biggest Mistake: Lack of Information
 
 In AI-assisted programming, the biggest mistake is **lack of information in the prompt**. Cursor isn't a mind reader. Telling it "fix this bug" will probably lead to failure. However, if you _dictate_ a detailed monologue explaining:
 
 - What the code should do.
 - What it's doing wrong now.
 - Which file(s) contain the problem.
 - What approach might work.
 - What libraries or patterns are being used.
 - ...and any other relevant detail that comes to mind...
 
 ...the chances of getting a useful solution skyrocket.
 
 ### Example Comparison
 
 **Typical Prompt (Vague):**  
 
 \`\`\`
 Add a search filter to the user list.
 \`\`\`
 
 _Result: Might do it frontend-only, or inefficiently._
 
 **Dictated Prompt (Detailed):**  
 
 \`\`\`
 Okay, need to add a name filter to the user list in UserList.tsx. It gets data from /api/users. Want a simple text input above the table. On typing, debounce for 300ms and call /api/users?search=term. Make sure the backend in server.ts (Prisma) modifies the query with WHERE name ILIKE '%term%'. Don't filter on the frontend, it's inefficient. Update the users state with the response. Placeholder: 'Search by name...'.
 \`\`\`
 
 _Result: Much more likely to be what you need._
 
 _Dictating the second prompt takes seconds. Typing it, much longer._
 
 ## Precise Vibe Coding?
 
 Some talk about "Vibe Coding" with AI, just going with the flow. This approach is similar in fluency – dictation keeps the _momentum_ – but insists on **absolute clarity**. You flow, yes, but explaining _everything_ with surgical detail as you flow.
 
 To explain something clearly, one needs to understand it (at least broadly). Dictating "forces" verbalization of the plan, which often clarifies one's own thoughts.
 
 ## Give It a Try
 
 If you use Cursor (or similar), try this technique:
 
 1. Set up a dictation app like WisprFlow with a convenient shortcut.
 2. Next time you're about to type a prompt, _stop_.
 3. Take a breath, press the dictation key, and _explain_ to the AI what's needed, with all the details that come to mind. Don't worry if it's not perfect, just talk.
 4. Release the key, quickly review the text, and hit \`Enter\`.
 
 This approach can make a **significant difference**, leading to richer prompts and better results when coding with AI.
 
 ## Article 2: Agents are Loops
 
 [#ai](https://dev.to/t/ai)[#llm](https://dev.to/t/llm)[#agents](https://dev.to/t/agents)[#gpt](https://dev.to/t/gpt)
 
 ## What's an Agent?
 
 "AI Agent" sounds complex, but often, the core is simpler than you think. An **AI Agent typically runs a Large Language Model (LLM) inside a loop.**
 
 This pseudocode captures the essence in JavaScript:  
 
 \`\`\`javascript
 // Environment holds state/context
 const env = { state: initialState }; // Simple object state
 // Tools available to the agent
 const tools = new Tools(env);
 // Instructions for the LLM
 const system_prompt = \`Your main mission, goals, constraints...\`;
 
 // The main agent loop
 while (true) {
   // (Needs a real break condition!)
   // 1. LLM Brain: Decide action based on prompt + state
   const action = llm.run(\`\${system_prompt} \${env.state}\`);
 
   // 2. System Hands: Run the actual code for the requested tool
   env.state = tools.run(action); // Update state with result
 }
 \`\`\`
 
 _This simple loop is the heart of an Agent._
 
 [![Diagram illustrating the AI Agent loop](https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fauck13euyolr1hti5nly.png)](https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fauck13euyolr1hti5nly.png)
 
 _Simplified cycle: Think -> Act -> Update State -> Repeat._
 
 ## Quick Breakdown
 
 1. **\`llm.run(...)\`**: The "brain". Uses instructions (\`system_prompt\`) + current situation (\`env.state\`) to decide the next \`action\`.
 2. **\`tools.run(action)\`**: The "hands". If \`action\` requests a tool, this executes the **real code** for that tool and updates \`env.state\`.
 
 The loop repeats, feeding the new state back to the LLM.
 
 ## Why Tools? Because LLMs Just Talk
 
 The \`LLM\` only outputs text. **It can't _do_ things directly** – no browsing, no file editing, no running commands. It needs "hands".
 
 **Tools** are those hands. They are functions the system executes _for_ the \`LLM\` when asked, allowing it to interact with the world.
 
 ## Defining and Using a Tool
 
 How does the \`LLM\` know about tools and when to use them?
 
 ### 1. What it is: The Tool Definition
 
 Each tool needs a clear definition passed to the \`LLM\`, detailing:
 
 - **Name:** Unique ID (e.g., \`runLinter\`).
 - **Description:** What the tool _is_ and _does_ (e.g., "Runs ESLint on JS code/file...").
 - **Input Parameters:** The _exact_ inputs needed (name, type, description for each).
 
 This definition tells the \`LLM\` the tool's capabilities and how to structure a request for it.  
 
 \`\`\`javascript
 // Example Tool Definition passed to the LLM API
 {
   type: "function",
   function: {
     name: "runLinter", // Unique Name
     description: "Runs ESLint on JS code/file, returns JSON errors or success message.", // Description
     parameters: { /* Input Parameters Schema */ }
   }
 }
 \`\`\`
 
 [![Diagram showing a Tool definition](https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F3mo2fh9h4pth3a5jv0gb.png)](https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F3mo2fh9h4pth3a5jv0gb.png)
 
 _A Tool is defined for the \`LLM\` by its Name, Description, and Parameters._
 
 ### 2. When to Use It: The System Prompt
 
 The main \`system_prompt\` gives the agent its core instructions and strategy.
 
 Crucially, it tells the \`LLM\` **when** and **how** to use its tools. It lists available tools and sets the rules for using them.
 
 > _Example:_ "You have the \`runLinter\` tool. _Always_ run it first. If it finds errors, fix the code, then run \`runLinter\` _again_ to verify before finishing."
 
 This ensures the \`LLM\` uses tools effectively within the loop.
 
 ## Hands-On: Building a Simple Linter Agent
 
 Let's see it in action. We'll walk through the key parts of a simple, working Node.js agent that fixes JavaScript linting errors using **one single tool**.
 
 You can find the _complete, runnable code_ (including the full System Prompt) for this example here:  
 **[simple-linter-agent](https://github.com/cloudx-labs/simple-linter-agent)**
 
 Here are the crucial pieces:
 
 ### 1. The System Prompt (\`src/config.js\` - Abbreviated)
 
 This snippet shows the structure and key instructions of the agent's programming.  
 
 \`\`\`javascript
 // src/config.js - System Prompt (Abbreviated)
 const config = {
   model: "gpt-4o",
   systemPrompt: \`
 You are an expert JavaScript assistant that helps fix linting errors...
 
 AVAILABLE TOOLS:
 - runLinter({ codeContent?: string, filePath?: string }): Executes ESLint...
 
 PROCESS TO FOLLOW:
 1. Receive code/path.
 2. **ALWAYS** use 'runLinter' first...
 3. Analyze errors...
 4. If no errors, return code...
 5. If errors:
     a. Modify code...
     b. **IMPORTANT:** Call 'runLinter' AGAIN to verify...
     c. If verified, return corrected code...
     d. If still errors after retry, return best effort...
 
 FINAL RESPONSE:
 Your final response MUST contain only the complete corrected code... strictly wrapped between <final_code>...</final_code>...
 
 // (Full details including TOOL CALL and FINAL RESPONSE examples in the repository code)
 \`,
 };
 
 export default config;
 \`\`\`
 
 ### 2. The Tool (\`src/tools/linter.js\` - Function Snippet)
 
 This shows the core logic of the _actual_ \`runLinter\` function executed by the system, omitting some boilerplate for clarity.  
 
 \`\`\`javascript
 // src/tools/linter.js - Core Tool Function (Simplified)
 import { ESLint } from "eslint";
 import fs from "fs"; // Still needed for context
 
 const runLinter = async ({ codeContent, filePath }) => {
   // --- Determine code source and handle temporary file logic ---
   // ... code to get codeToLint and manage useFilePath ...
   // ... includes fs.readFileSync/writeFileSync logic ...
 
   try {
     // --- Core ESLint Execution ---
     const eslint = new ESLint({ fix: false, useEslintrc: true });
     const results = await eslint.lintFiles([
       /* determined file path */
     ]);
 
     // --- Process Results ---
     const errors = results.flatMap(/* ... map results to error objects ... */);
 
     // --- Cleanup & Return ---
     // ... unlink temporary file if used ...
     return errors.length === 0
       ? { result: "No linting errors found!" }
       : { errors: JSON.stringify(errors) };
   } catch (err) {
     // --- Error Handling & Cleanup ---
     // ... unlink temporary file ...
     console.error("Error running ESLint:", err);
     return { error: \`ESLint execution error: \${err.message}\` };
   }
 };
 
 // --- The Definition Exported for the Agent/LLM ---
 export default {
   name: "runLinter",
   description: "Runs ESLint on JS code/file...",
   parameters: {
     /* ... parameter schema ... */
   },
   function: runLinter, // Link to the actual function above
 };
 \`\`\`
 
 ### 3. The Loop (\`src/agent/agentInvoker.js\` - Core Logic Snippet)
 
 This snippet highlights the agent's execution flow: calling the \`LLM\`, handling tool calls, and updating the state.  
 
 \`\`\`javascript
 // Inside src/agent/agentInvoker.js (Simplified Core Loop)
 import linterTool from "../tools/linter.js";
 import config from "../config.js";
 import memory from "./memory.js";
 // ... other functions: callLLM(messages), handleToolCall(toolCall) ...
 
 const tools = [/* ... tool definition structure using linterTool ... */];
 
 const invokeAgent = async (conversationId, inputs) => {
   // ... setup initial user message in memory ...
 
   const MAX_ITERATIONS = 3;
   let finalCode = null;
 
   // === THE AGENT LOOP ===
   for (let i = 0; i < MAX_ITERATIONS; i++) {
     const messages = memory.getMessages(conversationId); // Get state
 
     // --- 1. LLM Brain: Decide action ---
     const llmResponse = await callLLM(messages);
     const assistantMessage = llmResponse.choices[0].message;
     memory.addMessage(conversationId, assistantMessage); // Store thought
 
     if (assistantMessage.tool_calls) {
       // --- 2. System Hands: Execute Tool ---
       for (const toolCall of assistantMessage.tool_calls) {
         if (toolCall.function.name === linterTool.name) {
            const toolResult = await handleToolCall(toolCall); // Run runLinter
            const toolResultContent = /* ... format result ... */ ;
            // --- 3. Update State ---
            memory.addMessage(conversationId, { role: "tool", /*...*/ content: toolResultContent });
         }
       }
     } else if (assistantMessage.content) {
       // --- LLM provided final answer ---
       const match = /* ... check for <final_code> ... */ ;
       if (match) { finalCode = match[0]; break; } // Goal achieved!
     } else { /* ... handle error ... */ break; }
   } // === END LOOP ===
 
   // ... handle loop finish ...
   return finalCode;
 };
 \`\`\`
 
 This structure demonstrates the **\`LLM\` (planning) + Loop (repetition) + Tool (action)** pattern.
 
 ## Connecting to More Complex Agents (like Cursor)
 
 Our simple linter agent uses just one tool, but it shows the fundamental pattern. Real-world agents like the **Cursor** operate on the exact same principle, just scaled up.
 
 Imagine asking Cursor to "Refactor \`ComponentA.jsx\` to use the new \`useDataFetching\` hook and update its tests in \`ComponentA.test.js\`." Cursor's \`LLM\` brain, guided by its own complex system prompt, might orchestrate a sequence like this within its loop:
 
 1. **Loop 1:** \`LLM\` thinks: "Need \`ComponentA.jsx\`." -> **Action:** Calls \`readFile(path="...")\`. System runs it.
 2. **Loop 2:** \`LLM\` thinks: "Need \`ComponentA.test.js\`." -> **Action:** Calls \`readFile(path="...")\`. System runs it.
 3. **Loop 3:** \`LLM\` thinks: "Plan JSX changes." -> **Action:** Calls \`editFile(path="...", changes=[...])\`. System runs it.
 4. **Loop 4:** \`LLM\` thinks: "Plan test changes." -> **Action:** Calls \`editFile(path="...", changes=[...])\`. System runs it.
 5. **Loop 5:** \`LLM\` thinks: "Verify changes." -> **Action:** Calls \`runTests(path="...")\`. System runs it.
 6. **Loop N:** (Continues...)
 
 It's the same **Think -> Act (Tool) -> Update State -> Repeat** cycle, just with more tools (\`readFile\`, \`editFile\`, \`runTests\`, etc.) and a more complex strategy. The core **\`LLM\` + Loop + Tools** architecture remains the same.
 
 ## The Pragmatic Takeaway
 
 Forget the complex hype around "AI Agents." The core is usually that straightforward **\`LLM\` + Loop + Tools** pattern:
 
 1. **\`LLM\` Thinks** (using System Prompt + Tool definitions + Current State)
 2. **System Acts** (running actual code for requested Tools)
 3. **Repeat**
 
 It's a simple, yet powerful, way to make \`LLM\`s accomplish real-world tasks.

 ## Article 3: Tool Usage Best Practices (Example Pattern)
 
 [#development][#tools][#productivity][#automation]
 
 ## The Problem: Inefficient Tool Usage
 
 Developers often use tools inefficiently, missing features that could save hours weekly. Common mistakes:
 
 - Using generic grep instead of ripgrep (5-10x slower)
 - Manual directory exploration instead of tree
 - Web interface for GitHub operations instead of gh CLI
 
 ## The Solution: Master Your Tools
 
 ### 1. Ripgrep Instead of Grep
 
 **Installation:**
 \`\`\`bash
 # macOS
 brew install ripgrep
 
 # Ubuntu/Debian
 sudo apt-get install ripgrep
 
 # From source
 cargo install ripgrep
 \`\`\`
 
 **Performance Comparison:**
 \`\`\`bash
 # Traditional grep (12.5 seconds)
 time grep -r "function.*export" ./src
 real    0m12.532s
 
 # Ripgrep (0.8 seconds)
 time rg "function.*export" ./src
 real    0m0.823s
 \`\`\`
 
 **Advanced Usage:**
 \`\`\`bash
 # Search only TypeScript files
 rg "interface" --type ts
 
 # Exclude node_modules automatically (built-in)
 rg "TODO" 
 
 # Show context
 rg -C 3 "deprecated"
 
 # Search and replace (dry run)
 rg "oldFunction" --replace "newFunction" --dry-run
 \`\`\`
 
 ### 2. Tree for Directory Visualization
 
 **Installation:**
 \`\`\`bash
 # macOS
 brew install tree
 
 # Ubuntu/Debian
 sudo apt-get install tree
 \`\`\`
 
 **Practical Examples:**
 \`\`\`bash
 # Show project structure (exclude common dirs)
 tree -I 'node_modules|.git|dist|coverage' -L 3
 
 # Output for documentation
 tree -I 'node_modules' --dirsfirst > project-structure.txt
 
 # Show only directories
 tree -d -L 2
 
 # Include file sizes
 tree -h --du
 \`\`\`
 
 ### 3. GitHub CLI for Efficiency
 
 **Installation:**
 \`\`\`bash
 # macOS
 brew install gh
 
 # Ubuntu/Debian
 curl -fsSL https://cli.github.com/packages/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg
 echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg] https://cli.github.com/packages stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/github-cli.list > /dev/null
 sudo apt update
 sudo apt install gh
 \`\`\`
 
 **Time-Saving Workflows:**
 \`\`\`bash
 # Clone any repo quickly
 gh repo clone owner/repo
 
 # Create PR from terminal
 gh pr create --title "Fix: Memory leak in worker" --body "Fixes #123"
 
 # Review PRs without leaving terminal
 gh pr view 456
 gh pr diff 456
 gh pr review 456 --approve
 
 # Quick issue creation
 gh issue create --title "Bug: Login fails on mobile" --label "bug,urgent"
 
 # Check CI status
 gh run list
 gh run watch
 \`\`\`
 
 ## Integration Example
 
 Here's a practical workflow combining all three tools:
 
 \`\`\`bash
 # 1. Explore project structure
 tree -I 'node_modules|.git' -L 2
 
 # 2. Find all TODO comments
 rg "TODO|FIXME" --type js --type ts
 
 # 3. Create issue for each TODO
 rg "TODO: (.*)" -r '$1' --no-filename | while read -r todo; do
   gh issue create --title "TODO: $todo" --label "technical-debt"
 done
 
 # 4. Find and fix deprecated function calls
 rg "deprecatedFunction" -l | xargs -I {} sed -i '' 's/deprecatedFunction/newFunction/g' {}
 
 # 5. Create PR with changes
 gh pr create --title "refactor: Replace deprecated functions" --body "Automated replacement of deprecatedFunction with newFunction across the codebase"
 \`\`\`
 
 ## Performance Metrics
 
 **Task: Search for pattern across large codebase (Linux kernel)**
 - grep: 45.2 seconds
 - ag (Silver Searcher): 4.8 seconds  
 - ripgrep: 0.9 seconds
 
 **Task: Generate project documentation structure**
 - Manual \`ls\` and formatting: 10-15 minutes
 - \`tree\` with proper flags: 2 seconds
 
 **Task: Create and manage PR**
 - GitHub web interface: 3-5 minutes
 - \`gh\` CLI: 30 seconds
 
 ## Usage Notes
 
 1. **Alias for Efficiency:**
    \`\`\`bash
    alias rgl="rg -l"  # List files only
    alias rgc="rg -c"  # Count matches
    alias tre="tree -I 'node_modules|.git' -L 3"
    \`\`\`
 
 2. **Integration with Editors:**
    - VS Code: Install "Ripgrep Search" extension
    - Vim: \`set grepprg=rg\\ --vimgrep\`
    - Emacs: \`(setq grep-command "rg -n")\`
 
 3. **Error Handling:**
    \`\`\`bash
    # Check if tools are installed
    command -v rg >/dev/null 2>&1 || { echo "ripgrep required but not installed."; exit 1; }
    \`\`\`
 
 ## The Pragmatic Takeaway
 
 Switching to optimized tools provides immediate, measurable benefits:
 - Search operations: 5-50x faster
 - Project navigation: Instant vs minutes  
 - GitHub operations: 80% time reduction
 
 Every developer should have these in their toolkit. The setup time (5 minutes) pays for itself within the first day of use.
